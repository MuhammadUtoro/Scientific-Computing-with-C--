This repository contains my learning tools for scientific computing with C++. The lessons are from the book:
Guide to Scientific Computing in C++ Second Edition by Joe-Pitt Francis and Jonathan Whiteley.
The exercises are also found in the book. I have denoted the exercise with this format:
Exercise [Chapter]_[Exercise Number].
My goal is to be able use C++ for numerical simulation, especially for fluid mechanics

Note: If commit and push process does not work and shows this kind of error: "can't push refs to remote try running pull", it means that the local and remote branch are not integrated yet. The solution is to run:
git pull --rebase origin on the terminal
